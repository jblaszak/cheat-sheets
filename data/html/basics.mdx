HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language!


### Declare HTML Version
Tell the browser which HTML version to use, defaults to latest version. Useful for older browsers.
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
```

### Tags
HTML is structured by wrapping content with tags corresponding to that element.
```
<tagname>Content</tagname>
```

### Self Closing Tags
Certain tags don't have content so they are considered self closing
```
<hr>
or also (based on personal preference)
<hr />
```
### Attributes
Tags also have attributes, with values between quotes.  Some attributes can be left without values and are considered to be "true".
The two examples below are treated the same.
```
<input type="text" required="true" />
<input type="text" required />
```
### Comments
Creating comments in HTML
```
<!-- this is 
a comment  in HTML-->
```
